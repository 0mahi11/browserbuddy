# Submissions

This directory contains all submissions to the project. Each submission is stored in its own folder within this directory.

Submissions are organized as follows:
- Each folder represents a unique submission
- The folder name typically corresponds to the submitter or project name
- Inside each folder, you'll find the submitted files and any related documentation

To add a new submission, create a new folder in this directory and place all relevant files within it.
